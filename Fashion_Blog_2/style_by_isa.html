    <h1>NYFW 2023 Spells Out Conservative</h1>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week" target="_blank">NYFW</a> is fast approaching! If you were to guess what style was trending this September, what would it be? If all you had to go on was what we saw last Spring then you would have likely guessed gaudy. Not this Fall, though! I have it on good authority that we are going to see a swing towards the <strong>conservative</strong>.</p>

    <h2>What to Wear</h2>
        <p>If <em>somehow</em> you were quick, fortunate, or known some one who knows some one who had a ticket you may be asking yourself, "what should I wear? How do I match this year's take on conservative?" My advice: don't overthink it. Whether you are a man or woman, here are three tried and true tips in dressing to stand out in a theme that demands not to.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Less is more</strong>. And by "less," I mean skin. In an age where everyone wants to show as much skin as possible, you will stand out by not drawing attention to your bare midriff.</li>
            <li><strong>Layers</strong>. The <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/us/new-york/10021/september-weather/349727" target="_blank">forecast</a> is showing that it's going to be a chilly September in the Big Apple. Take advantage of this cold front and add on an extra layer. Make sure it's bold and stands out against your inner layer.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessorize</strong>. Just because you are dressing like your Baptist grandmother doesn't mean you have to leave fancy at home. Make sure to bring a handbag, handkerchief, or necklace to round out your outfit.</li>
        </ul>
